# Peasel

Peasel is a website that utilizes HTML's canvas tag to display a blank canvas that allows the user to create pixel art. In its current form, users can have a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 grid. They can add black pixels and delete the whole canvas. There are non-working buttons that will have functionality added to them in the future.
