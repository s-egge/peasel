# Peasel

Peasel is a website that utilizes HTML's canvas tag to display a blank canvas that allows the user to create pixel art. 

To run the program:
* Download code
* In terminal, run 'npm install'
* In terminal, run 'npm start'
* In browser, go to 'localhost:3000'

## Current functionality:

* Grid-size: The user can initially choose from a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 grid.

* Eraser: Erasing can be done with drag-and-draw or a single click.

* Eyedropper: Replaces the left-mouse color with the color that is clicked on.
* Color Swatches: A left and right color swatch for changing left/right mouse colors.
* Random-color: The dice icon when clicked will generate a random color for the left-mouse color-swatch.
* Swap-colors: This swaps the left and right colors.

## Future functionality:

* Grid-size: Will change the size of the grid after initial entry.
* Save: Will save the pixel-art as a download.
